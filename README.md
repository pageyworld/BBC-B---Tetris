# BBC-B---Tetris - West Yorkshire Edition
First Attempt at creating Tetris for the BBC B - Themed in a Yorkshire style

What's this all abaht?
It's not the flashiest version yet, mind ya, but we're gettin' there.

How to Get Stuck In:
Fire up your BBC B: Load 'er up, mate!
Run the BASIC file: Give it a whirl with that there BASIC file.
Control instructions: It's all arrows and spacebar right nowâ€”keep it simple.
T' Limmy-Tations:
Reckon we've got a fair few limitations here:

Speed's a bit dodgy: It's BASIC, innit? Slow and steady.
Fancy features on hold: Can't go full throttle on the bells and whistles yet.
Not the slickest gameplay: Could be a bit jumpy, but we'll sort that out.

One day...to be in assembler
